It makes no sense to touch the toilet seat every time you have to you use the toilet.
It is filled with germs which only needs microseconds to get transferred to your hand. 
(FYI the 5 second rule is fallacious ).

Anyways, it makes sense to NOT have a deluge of germs on your body every day.
For this, I prototyped a voice controlled toilet seat lifter which allows you to open and close the seat using simple voice commands.

Like every idea, I thought this was unique but it turns out that "smart-toilets" already exist. I am still proud to have noticed a very common problem which 
millions oversee everyday and to have a prototyped a good solution for that. 

Feel free to use the code which, btw, has nothing byzantine in it.
I have used IFTTT, BLYNK and the nodemcu board.

P.S.
Have attached a video of the prototype working. The reaction time and the prototype are slighlty bad due to poor data and even more 
shoddy model building skills. The electronics part would work great though as I am adept in that.
