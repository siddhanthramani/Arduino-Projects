If you have watched funny football videos, it will almost always include footballers running away from the field when the lawn sprinklers get activated 
and spray water on them.
Sprinklers could be annoying even in tech parks, universities and other places where they water not only the lawn, but also footpaths, making them slippery.

This is a simple project which can detect if any person is walking in front of the sprinkler nozzle and automatically reduce the power with which water 
is sprayed depending on the distance of the person from the sprinkler.
