Hello!

I wrote this code to help Park Mung-hoon and Kang-Ho Song from the movie parasite.
They were having a pretty difficult time to communicate to the outside world 
using morse.

This arduino code will blink and rgb led in morse.

Input should be in the arduino serial terminal.
Output is blinking led which will change colors after every word to better 
help the viewer.

Feel free to use this code.Credit me for the codd though.

Have a good day! :)
