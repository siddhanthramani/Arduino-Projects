Pigeons keep trying to build nests on top of my Grandmom's water tank. One even fell inside the tank and died.
As my grandmom is old and it is tiring for her to continually watch out for the pigeons and scare them away, I built a simple project 
to scare the pigeons away whenever they come neat the water tank. 

The project uses ultrasonic sensors and buzzer which will turn on (for ten seconds) if the bord comes closer to the sensor than a certain threshold value.
The threshold value is automatically set once you reset your arduino code. 

An improvement could be to allow the user to set the threshold using the app.

This could also be used to scare the squirrels which build nests near our windows or the crows which try to steal the food we keep
in the terrace for drying. (The last use case was suggested by my mothers collegue)
