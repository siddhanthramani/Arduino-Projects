When you leave your car outside during the day and enter it afterwards, the car is 
very hot and stuffy.Turning on the AC requires some time to cool the car down. Windows
also have to be opened to push the hot air out faster. This is a big problem in 
places like chennai where the heat gets extreme during the summer.

This arduino code is a small project which through a NodeMCu board allows an app
to turn on the AC even before the user enter.
The user, with a click of button can get the AC in the car running therby entering
an already cooled car after a hard day of work.

This works only on a prototype and not an actual car.
We are yet to build the prototype to produce a working model. Therefore, there could
be some changes to the code later on.
