This idea is not my own. I did this after seeing a video on Facebook.
I did this project for fun as I used to play the dino game in my school lab with my classmates and I found the implementation simple and interesting.

The project uses an LDR to measure the intensity of light and to jump accordingly.

An improvement that I have added is to have the dino game automatically detect and set threshold when the game shifts from the day to night and vice versa.

Furthur improvements could be to detect the speed at which the dino is running and jumping at the optimum location so as to never lose.
